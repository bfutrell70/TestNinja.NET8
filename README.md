# TestNinja.NET8

This is a copy of the TestNinja solution from Mosh Hamedani's
Unit Testing for C# Developers course on the Udemy site.

The original code uses the .NET Classic 4.5 framework. This
code uses .NET 8, with all libraries using the latest version
of libraries compatible with .NET 8. This should make this
code multi-platform. Verified this by opening the solution on
a Raspberry Pi 400 running Raspberry Pi OS (Debian) with .NET 8 
and Visual Studio Code installed.

I have attempted to add comments to explain code changes made 
to fix errors or warnings reported by Visual Studio.
